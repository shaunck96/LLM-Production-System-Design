[31m-> Vulnerability found in transformers version 4.36.1[0m
[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m71601
[1m   Affected spec: [0m<4.38.0
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mThe huggingface/transformers library is vulnerable to
   arbitrary code execution through deserialization of untrusted data within
   the `load_repo_checkpoint()` function of the `TFPreTrainedModel()` class.
   Attackers can execute arbitrary code and commands by crafting a malicious
   serialized payload, exploiting the use of `pickle.load()` on data from
   potentially untrusted sources. This vulnerability allows for remote code
   execution (RCE) by deceiving victims into loading a seemingly harmless
   checkpoint during a normal training process, thereby enabling attackers to
   execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine.

[1m   Vulnerability ID: [0m71670
[1m   Affected spec: [0m>=0
[1m   ADVISORY: [0mA vulnerability in the PyTorch's torch.distributed.rpc
   framework, specifically in versions prior to 2.2.2, allows for remote code
   execution (RCE). The framework, which is used in distributed training
   scenarios, does not properly verify the functions being called during RPC
   (Remote Procedure Call) operations. This oversight permits attackers to
   execute arbitrary commands by leveraging built-in Python functions such as
   eval during multi-cpu RPC communication. The vulnerability arises from the
   lack of restriction on function calls when a worker node serializes and
   sends a PythonUDF (User Defined Function) to the master node, which then
   deserializes and executes the function without validation. This flaw can
   be exploited to compromise master nodes initiating distributed training,
   potentially leading to the theft of sensitive AI-related data.
